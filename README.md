Below are the important points to note:

1. We have used only the components, images, and templates folders to develop the email.
2. Inside the components folder, we have used only sections, and inside the templates folder, the index.html file is used.
3. In the Figma design, there were some canvas elements, but since email clients don't support canvas, we have used images instead.
4. The Call-to-Action (CTA) in the Figma design had rounded corners. However, Litmus does not support rounded corner CTAs, so border-radius has not been used for the CTA.
5. Only the files mentioned above are used in this project. Please disregard any other files as they are not used.
